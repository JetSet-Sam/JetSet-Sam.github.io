            <h3>Work History:</h3>
            <p>
              I've been out working on all sorts of jobs through the years I've
              gained all kinds of work experience from baby sitting to pet
              sitting and even the almighty janitor it's a hard business but
              it's honest work which makes the dreams works. I haven't truly
              discovered my true passion yet but I think I have decided as to
              what my career will be for now. Even now what my true passion is
              still eludes me to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The picture you see to the right is one of my favorite bands, Daft
              Punk I really love their blend of electronic sounds into their
              music. I recommend that you give them a listen when you have the
              chance.
